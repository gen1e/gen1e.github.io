In HFOSS class we had our Commarch project. This was a group project where we anaylized an open source project's git repository. My team decided to do Jekyll. Our proposal can be found [on our GitHub repository](https://github.com/axk4545/hfoss-commarch/blob/master/teamproposal.md). You can also find the [full report](https://github.com/axk4545/hfoss-commarch/blob/master/report.md) and [the source](https://github.com/axk4545/hfoss-commarch/tree/master/presentation) for our [presentation](https://gen1e.github.io/commarch/).

We used [git by a bus v2](https://github.com/tomheon/git_by_a_bus/tree/v2) to get data and [git by a lion](https://github.com/liam-middlebrook/git_by_a_lion) to process that output. We also calculated the [Callaway Coefficient of Fail](https://github.com/ritjoe/hfoss/blob/master/assets/tomspotcallaway-howtotellifyourfossprojectisdoomedtofail.pdf) that is also in [our repo](https://github.com/axk4545/hfoss-commarch).

I found the project to be very interesting and really helped me to connect a lot of the conepts we talked about when reading Eghbal's "Roads and Bridges" to a real world project.

One of my favorite webcomics ever is [Pepper & Carrot](https://www.peppercarrot.com/en/static3/webcomics). Its about a young witch named Pepper who is not very good at witching and her adventures with her tabby cat companion Carrot. IT IS ADORABLE! Like seriously it's so incredibly cute. It's created by an awesome French artist named David Reevoy. Not only is he talented but he's also super into open source. As part of this his software work flow is completely open source for Pepper & Carrot.  He uses Krita for his drawing, Blender for textures, and GIMP and Inkscape for other touch ups and adding text. He also creates the webcomic with a certain [philosophy](https://www.peppercarrot.com/en/static2/philosophy) in mind. He believes that all of Pepper & Carrot should be open source. He does this by licensing the work under Creative Commons and making the assets he used freely available. He has a [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/davidrevoy) that allows people to support him but any content that is posted on their is also posted on the public Pepper & Carrot website because he doesn't want to lock anything behind a pay-wall. 

The really cool thing was that people actually use the permissive license to remix his work. There was a very popular [animation of his comic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTb1_w8hvqY) lead by Nikolai Mamashev and Konstantin Dmitriev. They used open source tools to animate Reevoy's comic. They did an [interview with opensource.com](https://opensource.com/article/17/6/web-comic-open-license) if you want to learn more about their project. 

Pepper & Carrot is a great example of a successful creative commons/open source artistic creation. The creator is still able to support himself while still keeping his work open source. The community also actually uses this permissive licensing to actually do some cool remixes of his work. It also shows that something of great quality can come from using FOSS software and that FOSS creative tools don't mean a sacrifice in outputted art quality. It's super awesome, check it out, it's definitely worth the read.

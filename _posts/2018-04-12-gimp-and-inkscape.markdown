As obvious by the title, I have a love hate relationship with both [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) and [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/). For the uninitiated, GIMP is an open source image editing program. GIMP is most similar to the proprietary industry standard of Adobe Photoshop. Inkscape is a vector graphics program that is similar in function to the proprietary industry standard Adobe Illustrator. I have a lot of experience with both as I used them to do design work for [TigerOS](https://github.com/RITlug/TigerOS), an open source remix of Fedora aimed specifically at getting RIT students into Linux. I was able to use Inkscape to create the TigorOS mascot and used GIMP to make the wallpapers. Although I appreciated being able to do design work using open source software, especially not having to pay for Adobe with both my arms and my legs, I always struggle with it. I know that it takes time to learn design software because it tends to be quite complex but I find both GIMP and Inkscape have quite a learning curve. The options bars along the side are a bit cryptic and it can be difficult to find things like layers at first. I know that both communities are making an effort to increase their user experience. Regardless, they both are valuable resources and are good open source solutions.

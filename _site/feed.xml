Due to busy schedules this was the first time I was able to attend Women in Computing’s all-women* hackathon. I participated with a group of friends. Our glorious group name was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gen1e.github.io/antifreezebears/&quot;&gt;AntiFreeze Bears&lt;/a&gt; (yes there is a story behind the name that we will eventually tell). As noted in &lt;a href=&quot;https://gen1e.github.io/hfoss/2018/02/13/my-love-hate-relationship-with-twine-and-harlowe.html&quot;&gt;one of my previous posts&lt;/a&gt;, we used &lt;a href=&quot;http://twinery.org/&quot;&gt;Twine&lt;/a&gt; to create a choose your own adventure game following Atalanta as she beings freshman year of high school and struggles with female stereotypes when entering her new school’s Robotics Club. The entire game is open source, you can see the code modifications we made on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gen1e/antifreezebears&quot;&gt;our GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, which is licensed under GPL 3.0. The written story and art assets we made are all licensed under Creative Commons (CC-BY 4.0). I was mostly in charge of writing the script as well as trying to make sure we were on track. Lauren DiDonato was our main web developer who made the website and a lot of the code changes. She also helped to keep us on track. Felix Brink was our designer who made all of our art assets and chose the color scheme. Eleanor Post helped to design the game mechanics and also added some branches to the story as well as revisions to the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had the idea previous to the hackathon but really hashed everything out when we got there. The GitHub repo has charts that we used to help plan. There were a lot of sticky notes involved with planning and we used a white board to setup a mini kanban board. It was the first hackathon where we all actually did a project instead of homework. Most of us stayed up the whole night or most of the night. That was an adventure. Lauren and I had to stay up late as WiC Committee Head to help hold down the fort. We slept in shifts on the floor. There was a lot of caffeine and energy drinks. At various points in the hackathon I helped here and there with people’s android projects. I remember somewhat vaguely helping with another team’s android app in the wee hours of the morning. The sleep deprivation makes the latter half of the hackathon kind of foggy but we did manage to complete our project and present it for judging. I uploaded the project to this site so you can see our homepage and play our game for yourself. We were really proud of ourselves for managing to create a finished product during WiCHacks and had a whole lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* I would like to note that there were also non-binary participants, one of which was on my team.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">This year I was thrilled to attend WiCHacks as a participant/volunteer.

I did not hack on a project but instead worked on homework. I did however talk to a few people who were there. I saw some friends from RIT’s MAGIC Center who I stopped to talk to for a bit. I also talked to a friend of mine Stefan Marchhart, was working on a project where he used open source python libraries to visualize music on Philips Hue lights which are able to light up different colors. His project is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Sciguystfm/HueVisualizer&quot;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; (sadly with no license). He talked to me and the group I was with about it during a 5 am Quiplash game break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I attended BrickHack with my friends and I spent most of my time watching and helping them make memes. Why? Because the student representatives from Google Cloud Platform decided that they would give sweet, sweet swag to those with the best memes throughout the hackathon. So began The Great BrickHack Meme Wars of 2018. The memes were actually super creative. What was interesting from an open source perspective was that (although no official licensing was involved), it was acceptable, even encouraged, to take someone else’s memes and do something different with it. The memes would sometime be a direct response to another. As the night went on the memes would become more and more meta, incorporating almost everyone else’s memes. It very much embodies what the creative commons and open source communities strive for; a positive environment to remix and share work to everyone’s benefit. Safe to say, anyone in the BrickHack 2018 Google Cloud Platform was incredibly entertained. Also my friends have now covered our apartment in Google Cloud Platform swag. It was a really great time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I attended RIT’s main hackathon BrickHack this year.

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UNIX was published, Michael Hart started digitizing texts for what became Project Gutenburg, and Bill Gates wrote his “Open Letter to Hobbyists”. [1 pt]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;b) 1970s

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*5) Several elements are combined in different ways to form the various Creative Commons licenses.
Please match each shorthand given in the numbered list with the letter next to the description of that license element below (2 pt for each match).\ *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;5.1) NC \C
5.2) SA \A
5.3) ND \D
5.4) BY \B
A) You must convey the same rights “downstream” that were conveyed to you by “upstream”.
B) You must attribute the contributions of the original or upstream creators of the work.
C) You may not use the work for commercial purposes.
D) You may not make changes to the work.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) The presence of which license elements make a license “non-free” in the eyes of the FSF? (give the letters, 1 pt XC each)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;C and D as they restrict the usage of the work in a way that is not free.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7) Which license element is a copyleft? (give the letter, 1 pt XC)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;A
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;8) Name two projects which distribute a body of non-software, free culture data, and briefly name or describe the kind of data. (1 pt XC each)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;8.1) Project Gutenberg - distrubutes e-books/pdfs of books that are in the public domain

8.2) Internet Archive - free books, videos, audios, and images - not all of them are free as in freedom but they are still included in the collection
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve discussed “the four R’s” as a shorthand for the freedoms attached to software for it to be considered “free” or “open source”. List or describe each. (eg, if you can remember the “r” word you can just give that. If you cannot remember the term, but can describe the freedom involved, that also counts). Various “r” words are roughly synonymous for some of the freedoms, but we’re counting freedoms here, not synonyms so if you give two (or more) terms for the same freedom, it only counts once. For the purposes of this quiz, “remix” does not count as describing any of them. (2pt each)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;9.1) Run

9.2) Read (the source)

9.3) Adapt to your liking, being able to change the software to fit your needs.

9.4) Redistribute

This is the idea that science should be open and available to everyone. Not only should research be openly published and distributed but it also should openly publish the data and code involved. This is in part to make it easier for scientists to question each other and to perform replication studies, where other scientists repeat the experiment to verify the results. The increasing usage of technology makes it more important for scientists to make available the kind of software or equipment they used to make it easier to do these replication studies.  Another reason is that by making the research open to see that innovation can happen faster, as there is less in the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of publishing there are a few open journals where the articles in the journal are openly available. One such journal is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/who-we-are&quot;&gt;PLOS journal&lt;/a&gt;. It &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/open-access&quot;&gt;requires that all articles are attributed using CC-BY&lt;/a&gt;. Those who want to publish however do have to pay a publishing fee, which is how they stay running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of open data, there are a few data repositories that have data that is open to use. NASA being one of these, making available not only data collected by their instruments but also some of their software. There are also APIs available for people to pull from as well. For their &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.nasa.gov/&quot;&gt;open data&lt;/a&gt; they also have a place to suggest data sets, which is really cool. There is some open science happening here at RIT as well. While talking to Dr. Jennifer Connelly from RIT’s Astronomy department, she mentioned another professor in the department, Dr. Michael Richmond, makes &lt;a href=&quot;http://spiff.rit.edu/richmond/ritobs/ritobs.html&quot;&gt;posts about his observations&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rit.edu/cos/observatory/&quot;&gt;RIT’s observatory website&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately his posts are unlicensed so it’s not open, but it is freely available on the internet. Seeing &lt;a href=&quot;http://spiff.rit.edu/richmond/ritobs/apr21_2018/apr21_2018.html&quot;&gt;one of his posts&lt;/a&gt;, you can see he gives a summary of his observations complete with charts and also offers the measurements he made in a text file that is available for download. It’s really awesome that he does this for those who do not have access to a professional telescope or want to see what other scientists are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will continue to watch the rise of open science and it’s presence in our RIT community.&lt;/p&gt;

This is partially because of working on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Women-in-Computing-at-RIT/Magic-Mirror&quot;&gt;Magic Mirror project&lt;/a&gt; as Women in Computing at RIT’s Projects Committee Head. At one point we were looking at various open source voice assistant/AIs to use. One of the main assistants we were looking at was &lt;a href=&quot;https://mycroft.ai/&quot;&gt;Mycroft&lt;/a&gt;. Mycroft is an open source AI licensed under Apache 2.0 and it is available on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-core&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. Mycroft is available on &lt;a href=&quot;https://mycroft.ai/get-mycroft/&quot;&gt;several platforms&lt;/a&gt; including their device the Mycroft Mark I, with their next version the Mark II currently in crowd funding and slated to be out December 2018. These devices serve as a direct competitor to proprietary assistants like Google Home and Amazon’s Alexa. Mycroft is not only an open source alternative to these devices but also serves as a platform that is much more privacy conscious. The best part about Mycroft is that is can be downloaded to run on a Raspberry Pi 3 so people can customize their hardware setup easily. Someone can get a better speaker or microphone for their setup. It can also be installed on most Linux desktop distros, much like having an assistant on other operating systems (I hope to install it on my desktop for fun when I get the time). It is also possible to get it onto Android if you are willing to go through android studio to hack it into an apk runnable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mycroft seems to be the most viable open source competitor to proprietary assistants, their successful kickstarter for their Mark I and currently successful campaign for their Mark II proving that. Full disclaimer, I have backed their Mycroft II Indiegogo campaign. They are one of the few open source AIs I’ve seen attempting to make a physical box aimed to eventually be able to be an out of the box experience, designed for those who have little to no technical skills. It’s worth noting that Mycroft is backed up by an actual company that decided to make their code open source. I’m very interested in this project and will continue to follow it as it grows, I encourage you to check it out for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Recently I’ve been interested in various AIs and virtual assistants.

One of those was RWAG which stands for RIT Wargaming Association and Guild. The name isn’t super descriptive but it’s essentially the boardgaming club on campus. Now when we’re talking about boardgames we’re talking about things much more entertaining than monopoly. More on the side of Catan or Risk. This also includes tabletop rpgs like Dungeons and Dragons. A lot of people have reservations about D&amp;amp;D thinking it’s only for stereotypical nerds or is something that is just made for TV nerds. In reality is much like cops and robbers for adults or structured improv. What many people don’t realize is that there is a world beyond D&amp;amp;D that have vastly different rules. Some games will publish their core mechanics in an open source SRD or System Reference Document. Unfortunately, sometimes this document is not super informative as the controversial 4th Edition D&amp;amp;D SRD which did not provide enough information to understand the game. At this time they also transitioned from an Open Game License (OGL) to a proprietary license. This partially contributed to the split from many people from 4th Edition to other similar systems such as Pathfinder, which is still today licensed under OGL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantage to an OGL license allows for many people to be able to create their own content for the game, or homebrew content, and be able to share it with the world. There tends to be a limitation with this that branding cannot be used and you cannot sell official content for the game without permission. There are a surprising amount of games that are licensed under OGL. A particularly awesome game used by many is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-core/&quot;&gt;FATE Core&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.evilhat.com/home/fae/&quot;&gt;FATE: Accelerated&lt;/a&gt;. They are both &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-core-downloads/&quot;&gt;available for download&lt;/a&gt; for free and they host &lt;a href=&quot;https://fate-srd.com/&quot;&gt;the SRD online&lt;/a&gt;, in line with their OGL license. It is a universal rpg system, which means it is not tied to a particular setting. You can use it to play anything from swashbuckling space pirates to havoc wrecking goblins. It is a very popular system for building you’re own world and want to focus on story. Also it’s worth it to note that Wizards of the Coast learned their lesson from D&amp;amp;D 4e and has released 5e under the OGL with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd&quot;&gt;complete SRD&lt;/a&gt;. I believe this attests to the quality that games with OGL can have as well as the community demand for using the license.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Like many college freshman I joined a lot of clubs when I got to RIT. One of those was RWAG which stands for RIT Wargaming Association and Guild. The name isn’t super descriptive but it’s essentially the boardgaming club on campus. Now when we’re talking about boardgames we’re talking about things much more entertaining than monopoly. More on the side of Catan or Risk. This also includes tabletop rpgs like Dungeons and Dragons. A lot of people have reservations about D&amp;amp;D thinking it’s only for stereotypical nerds or is something that is just made for TV nerds. In reality is much like cops and robbers for adults or structured improv. What many people don’t realize is that there is a world beyond D&amp;amp;D that have vastly different rules. Some games will publish their core mechanics in an open source SRD or System Reference Document. Unfortunately, sometimes this document is not super informative as the controversial 4th Edition D&amp;amp;D SRD which did not provide enough information to understand the game. At this time they also transitioned from an Open Game License (OGL) to a proprietary license. This partially contributed to the split from many people from 4th Edition to other similar systems such as Pathfinder, which is still today licensed under OGL.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">HFOSS Commarch Project: Jekyll</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/hfoss/2018/03/27/commarch.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="HFOSS Commarch Project: Jekyll" /><published>2018-03-27T01:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-03-27T01:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/hfoss/2018/03/27/commarch</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/hfoss/2018/03/27/commarch.html">&lt;p&gt;In HFOSS class we had our Commarch project.

I find it fascinating. For many years the main patrons of the arts were the rich and powerful. This was also similar for sciences where scientists had patrons to support their work. As time went on other methods of supporting the arts developed and the same for sciences. Crowdfunding I see as coming full circle to original idea of patronage, but instead of the rich and powerful it’s usually the middle class or the common person. There are a few different kinds of crowdfunding. The smallest kind tends to be more of a tip jar, where a patron gives someone enough to buy a cup of coffee. This tends to be for people who produce content on a more casual basis, and often have a day job. For bigger creators there are platforms like Patreon where someone can pledge a monthly amount. The subscription can sometimes give you access to different levels of extra content depending on the level of subscription payment. There are also platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo, where someone creates a campaign with a certain monetary goal to achieve a certain produced output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally have seen a lot of great things come out of crowdfunding. A lot of cool indie boardgames come out of kickstarters. There are great creators that can be supported to create full time for the most part. This applies to FOSS in that there are some free and open source projects that can be supported through this crowdfunding. This can be open source games such as the tabletop rpg &lt;a href=&quot;http://openlegendrpg.com/&quot;&gt;Open Legend&lt;/a&gt; or it can be artists releasing under creative commons such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.peppercarrot.com/&quot;&gt;David Revoy with his Pepper and Carrot webcomic&lt;/a&gt;. It can also be technical projects. I personally recently backed the open source voice assistant &lt;a href=&quot;https://mycroft.ai/&quot;&gt;Mycroft&lt;/a&gt; to develop a second iteration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have often been told that there are times where you “vote with your money,” and crowdfunding creates and environment where common people can show their support for open source projects in a manageable way.  By spending money on an open source assistant that is more privacy focused, I tell the rest of the market that I don’t want you spying me constantly. The success of these campaigns can have an impact on the market the creation is in, potentially changing various standards. I really like crowdfunding, although I realize there are some risks that come with crowdfunding, I feel the benefits often outway the risks.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I mentioned briefly in my litreview 3 post that I’m a fan of crowdfunding.

The &lt;a href=&quot;https://gen1e.github.io/hfoss/2018/03/05/litreview2.html&quot;&gt;first part of the report&lt;/a&gt; focused on the problems of our deteriorating digital infrastructure made up of open source projects and why they were having them. This second part focuses more on how some open source projects are sustaining themselves and how we can better help to support them in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some open source projects are able to monetize their project in some way. This is often done when a service can be provided such as hosting the running software or by providing enterprise support. For some projects this is not feasible and some projects will resort to consulting as a way to fund themselves. Another way to fund open source projects has been to post bounties on certain issues in an effort to fund contributors for their time. As the author points out this can result in people contributing for the wrong reasons and people doing a mediocre job then dropping off the face of the earth. A revenue stream that I found very interesting was the potential for paid licenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general idea behind paid licenses is something in between a proprietary license and an open license. The biggest example of this kind of license is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fair.io/&quot;&gt;Fair Source&lt;/a&gt; license, as mentioned in the report. This license allows free use and access to the source code up to a certain number of users; making it free and viewable source for personal and small business use but allows the creators to charge for large business use. The report mentions this as a way for a project to pay for itself but the author brings up that this is controversial. This license goes against the idea of open source by limiting the freedom to a certain point. It’s also not feasible for library or plugin projects. Although I don’t see this as helpful to open source projects as it is against it’s philosophy, I see this as a great way to have our code to be more open overall. We will always be in a world where proprietary software will exist  (though I will gladly eat my words should that change). I see the Fair Source license as a way to get companies that would usually keep all of their code closed source to pick this license instead. It’s more of “something is better than nothing” kind of situation, where we can attempt to get companies who would consider open sourcing their software to use a fair source license to keep at least part of it free, but also re-assure them that they will be able to make money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author also mentions crowdfunding as a way to fund open source projects. Django is mentioned as a project that was able to successfully launch a kickstarter campaign to fund some database work. Crowdfunding campaigns are an interesting recent phenomenon. Essentially, someone creates content that explains what they would like to achieve and what you would get should you give money upfront to back the project. Supporting a project is no guarantee for it’s completion nor that if it fails you will get your money back. However, there have been many successful campaigns. I find crowdfunding interesting because it is a way for the common person to be a patron of the arts or an investor. You don’t have to be rich to fund a campaign. This is also part of the problem as these campaigns are generally aimed at middle class to low upper class people. There have been companies to back crowdfunding campaigns but it’s rare. I think though that this is a good option for medium sized projects to help get some stretches of work done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other methods for funding open source projects such as companies sponsoring someone or putting one of their salaried employees on an open source project, usually one of the maintainers. There has been an increase in companies encouraging some of their employees on company time. I think that this is an effective way of combating the issue of  having one maintainer and not having enough human resources. The author also mentioned foundations. I was specifically interested in the grants given out by the Mozilla foundation and Linux Foundation, who were both gathering funds to attempt to support infrastructure projects. I also think this is great as there are organizations that can research and attempt to figure out what is needed where the most and are large and notable, making it more likely for them to get funding from companies. Another method I found very interesting is through academic institutions. Research at universities can both start and support existing open source projects. This can help support the system by adding contributors and potentially supporting maintainers who teach or if the project can contribute to research. RIT’s open source community and FOSS minor are great instances of that. Our class, Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software, is a great way to get people introduced to open source software and encourage them to contribute. There is also a FOSS projects class where there are students working on, you guessed it, open source projects. By introducing open source to the curriculum they can increase the amount of contributors to open source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author also discusses how to help open source projects going forward. The main issues that were pointed out were raising awareness of the lack of support for our open source digital infrastructure, working with projects for improvement, and expanding the pool of contributors. I agree with the author’s assessment and believe that further campaigning to get companies involved and people aware of this problem. Overall, I feel this report is well written, especially for those who are not developers and is a good resource for those trying to raise awareness for this issue.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">For this litreview, we continued from p77 of Roads and Bridges: The Unseen Labor Behind Our Digital Infrastructure by Nadia Eghbal published on July 14, 2016, and finished reading the report.

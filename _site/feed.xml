The &lt;a href=&quot;https://gen1e.github.io/hfoss/2018/03/05/litreview2.html&quot;&gt;first part of the report&lt;/a&gt; focused on the problems of our deteriorating digital infrastructure made up of open source projects and why they were having them. This second part focuses more on how some open source projects are sustaining themselves and how we can better help to support them in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some open source projects are able to monetize their project in some way. This is often done when a service can be provided such as hosting the running software or by providing enterprise support. For some projects this is not feasible and some projects will resort to consulting as a way to fund themselves. Another way to fund open source projects has been to post bounties on certain issues in an effort to fund contributors for their time. As the author points out this can result in people contributing for the wrong reasons and people doing a mediocre job then dropping off the face of the earth. A revenue stream that I found very interesting was the potential for paid licenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general idea behind paid licenses is something in between a proprietary license and an open license. The biggest example of this kind of license is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fair.io/&quot;&gt;Fair Source&lt;/a&gt; license, as mentioned in the report. This license allows free use and access to the source code up to a certain number of users; making it free and viewable source for personal and small business use but allows the creators to charge for large business use. The report mentions this as a way for a project to pay for itself but the author brings up that this is controversial. This license goes against the idea of open source by limiting the freedom to a certain point. It’s also not feasible for library or plugin projects. Although I don’t see this as helpful to open source projects as it is against it’s philosophy, I see this as a great way to have our code to be more open overall. We will always be in a world where proprietary software will exist  (though I will gladly eat my words should that change). I see the Fair Source license as a way to get companies that would usually keep all of their code closed source to pick this license instead. It’s more of “something is better than nothing” kind of situation, where we can attempt to get companies who would consider open sourcing their software to use a fair source license to keep at least part of it free, but also re-assure them that they will be able to make money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author also mentions crowdfunding as a way to fund open source projects. Django is mentioned as a project that was able to successfully launch a kickstarter campaign to fund some database work. Crowdfunding campaigns are an interesting recent phenomenon. Essentially, someone creates content that explains what they would like to achieve and what you would get should you give money upfront to back the project. Supporting a project is no guarantee for it’s completion nor that if it fails you will get your money back. However, there have been many successful campaigns. I find crowdfunding interesting because it is a way for the common person to be a patron of the arts or an investor. You don’t have to be rich to fund a campaign. This is also part of the problem as these campaigns are generally aimed at middle class to low upper class people. There have been companies to back crowdfunding campaigns but it’s rare. I think though that this is a good option for medium sized projects to help get some stretches of work done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other methods for funding open source projects such as companies sponsoring someone or putting one of their salaried employees on an open source project, usually one of the maintainers. There has been an increase in companies encouraging some of their employees on company time. I think that this is an effective way of combating the issue of  having one maintainer and not having enough human resources. The author also mentioned foundations. I was specifically interested in the grants given out by the Mozilla foundation and Linux Foundation, who were both gathering funds to attempt to support infrastructure projects. I also think this is great as there are organizations that can research and attempt to figure out what is needed where the most and are large and notable, making it more likely for them to get funding from companies. Another method I found very interesting is through academic institutions. Research at universities can both start and support existing open source projects. This can help support the system by adding contributors and potentially supporting maintainers who teach or if the project can contribute to research. RIT’s open source community and FOSS minor are great instances of that. Our class, Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software, is a great way to get people introduced to open source software and encourage them to contribute. There is also a FOSS projects class where there are students working on, you guessed it, open source projects. By introducing open source to the curriculum they can increase the amount of contributors to open source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author also discusses how to help open source projects going forward. The main issues that were pointed out were raising awareness of the lack of support for our open source digital infrastructure, working with projects for improvement, and expanding the pool of contributors. I agree with the author’s assessment and believe that further campaigning to get companies involved and people aware of this problem. Overall, I feel this report is well written, especially for those who are not developers and is a good resource for those trying to raise awareness for this issue.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">For this litreview, we continued from p77 of Roads and Bridges: The Unseen Labor Behind Our Digital Infrastructure by Nadia Eghbal published on July 14, 2016, and finished reading the report.

(eg, if you can remember the “r” word you can just give that. If you cannot remember the term, but can describe the freedom involved, that also counts). Various “r” words are roughly synonymous for some of the freedoms, but we’re counting freedoms here, not synonyms so if you give two (or more) terms for the same freedom, it only counts once. For the purposes of this quiz, “remix” does not count as describing any of them. (1pt each)&lt;/p&gt;

I really like playing tabletop RPGs, and I’m particularly fond of D&amp;amp;D 5e. I’m currently DMing a campaign for some of my friends (9 of them in fact, and yes I’m a badass DM for taking on that big of a group). Now I don’t always plan for my sessions (sometimes I use previous notes) but when I do I use markdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/i-dont-always-dnd.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;I don't always plan for my D&amp;amp;D sessions but when I do, I do it in Markdown&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the only thing I use markdown for, I also use it for other things. I usually use it for notes, task lists (before I started mainly using trello), and I’m using it right now for blog posts. But what is markdown? Well it’s a very simple markup language used by many as a “simpler” html. Markdown is a way to easily wrote down significant amounts of text and then convert that text directly to html. It has syntax to simplify certain html tags but also supports having html directly in the document. It was &lt;a href=&quot;https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&quot;&gt;originally created by John Gruber&lt;/a&gt; but has been adapted by various people and communities into different &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/commonmark/CommonMark/wiki/Markdown-Flavors&quot;&gt;flavors&lt;/a&gt;. As you can see by the list of some of the flavors, there are quite a few of them. Although the basics tend to be the same they all add different capabilities to markdown. Those who dislike markdown often point to this lack of standardization as a disadvantage to the language. While this is true, I find that most of the time as long as you are consistent about which flavor you use there aren’t that many problems. However, markdown is very easy to read on it’s own, even when not rendered as html in a browser. This is also why I like markdown. A big reason I use markdown is because it is based in plain text and simple to understand on it’s own it is more future proof and not necessarily reliant on one product or app for notes &lt;em&gt;cough cough&lt;/em&gt; Microsoft Word &lt;em&gt;cough cough&lt;/em&gt;. It also doesn’t require the use of proprietary software which is nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of tools, there are many FOSS editors you can use with markdown. You can use any plain text editor but I prefer the ones with syntax highlighting for markdown and those that provide a preview mode to show what it will look like when rendered in a browser as html. On my local computer I usually use &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt; with the markdown plugin &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/atom-community/markdown-preview-plus&quot;&gt;Markdown Preview Plus (MPP)&lt;/a&gt;. I really like Atom, particularly it’s dark theme is really nice. 
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/atom.png&quot; alt=&quot;Atom editor with preview package open&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use google drive a lot (RIT students get unlimited storage) so when I’m working on lab computers and want to remember to save my notes, I use StackEdit to make sure it’s in the drive. &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackedit.io/&quot;&gt;StackEdit&lt;/a&gt; is an open source browser editor. It supports markdown and links directly into google drive. It also provides a markdown preview mode which is nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a useful tool called &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandoc.org/&quot;&gt;pandoc&lt;/a&gt; which converts one kind of document to another. It supports a number of document types including markdown. It can be used to convert markdown to html or pdf or a multitude of formats. You can write a book in markdown and configure pandoc to convert it into various ebook/pdf formats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are different markup languages that are similar to markdown, though I only really heard of these, I haven’t really used them. The closest one is probably &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText&quot;&gt;reStructuredText&lt;/a&gt;, though &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mundimark/awesome-markdown-alternatives&quot;&gt;there exists a list of alternatives&lt;/a&gt; that are close to markdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally I love markdown and will continue to happily use it for various notes and writings.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">So if you haven’t noticed so far in this blog, I’m a bit of a nerd.

&lt;p&gt;Our first reading was about a problematic &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/19883&quot;&gt;NPM bug&lt;/a&gt; where Linux file permissions were being altered, that was written as an issue by the GitHub user Crunkle on February 22, 2018. The best way to describe the seriousness of the bug was the description that “People experiencing this bug will likely have to fully reinstall their system due to this update.” Yeah that’s a pretty big problem. Other than the bug itself, there was a lot of backlash in the comments of this issue because NPM made the 5.7.0 seem like a release as opposed to a pre-release which meant some users got confused and put this very broken code on production systems, which would then crash because of the issues. This set off a bit of a war in the comments. There were people calling each other incompetent because of their production upgrading procedures. Then there were people being very upset at and sometimes rude to the NPM devs for allowing such a big bug to be allowed in and making 5.7.0 look like a release. It got bad enough that the main collaborators locked the issue thread to collaborators. The issue was eventually fixed and 5.7.1 was released and 5.7.0 taken down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some things to be learned from this situation. It seems like the NPM developers need to be more clear about communicating which updates are releases and what is a pre-release. It seems their communication needs to be improved. Though it also seems to be that people got a little too overzealous and contributed more fuel to the fire instead of helping to resolve the situation. The NPM team seems to have handled this the best they could at the time. It’s hard to handle large amounts of backlash and according to the timestamps they handled the matter relatively quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-digital-infrastructure-is-crumbling-and-foss-is-struggling&quot;&gt;Why Digital Infrastructure is Crumbling and FOSS is Struggling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our second reading was &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ritjoe/hfoss/blob/master/assets/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure.pdf&quot;&gt;Roads and Bridges: The Unseen Labor Behind Our Digital Infrastructure by Nadia Eghbal&lt;/a&gt; published on July 14, 2016, from the beginning up to page 77. This is a fascinating read. The author’s main point is that most of the software we know today is built upon open source software. Everything involves software now from out computers and smart-phones to doing regular tasks such as buying things online, paying bills, or going to the doctor. Every business has some sort of tech infrastructure. The overwhelming majority of this software uses something that is open source. Eghbal emphasizes the importance of FOSS as an essential part of our digital infrastructure. She also described the practical aspects of FOSS. Because the software is free developers are able to build applications faster and for a fraction of the cost when proprietary software was dominant. This makes is easier to for startups because of the dramatically reduced cost. It is also useful for education as the tools are free to use for teaching. As such it is essential to keep those open source projects going. However these FOSS projects are often not seen often because like roads and electricity most people don’t think about who’s managing it when they are using roads to drive their car or turning on a light switch. These projects need funding and contributors to keep going. Eghbal explains how some projects are large enough to get money through companies sponsoring them and through donations. Though some projects are able to sustain themselves through enterprise support or special features they can sell. Besides money there is the problem of getting enough contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author covers that in open source’s early days there were a roughly an equal amount of people contributing to open source projects as there were those using it. This made the projects sustainable. In recent years there has been a dramatic increase in users and a decrease in people able to contribute. The author also talks about “magpie developers” who want to contribute to the new shiny projects as opposed to the older projects who need help also. Eghbal also describes a problem where some people in the open source community believe that there is a decrease in people able to contributre substantial code to the project. These developers are less experienced and so can’t contribute much code and/or create more work for the other contributors. This is where I disagree a bit. Although there are definitely people who are less experienced, it’s important to realize that all of us were at that stage at some point and to be compassionate about that. The key is to make sure a project is a welcoming community and helps to encourage those new developers to hone their skills and so will contribute better and better code as time goes on. This problem can be exacerbated by people who just see themselves as users and so only demand things of the project team. This doesn’t mean that those who are trying to contribute should be valued so much less so because their skills are not coding. Projects need to invest in new developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other problem often has to do with depending on the one or two maintainers to be the sole administrative force of the project while doing a lot of the coding. It seems that there are quite a few projects need to have better organization. What doesn’t help is that those who start the project are often the people who just want to code not be a project manager. This can be where people who don’t code or who don’t code that much can help out with open source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall I really enjoyed this read about issues in FOSS and the wider effects of that although I didn’t quite agree with everything the author said.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">NPM Bug Our first reading was about a problematic NPM bug where Linux file permissions were being altered, that was written as an issue by the GitHub user Crunkle on February 22, 2018.

In particular I’m involved with Projects Committee, of which I’m the committee head. Every year the committee picks a project to do, this year we are doing a magic mirror or smart mirror. A magic mirror is a monitor usually hooked up to a raspberry pi where white text is displayed on a black background. The monitor is covered by a one way mirror, usually a piece of acrylic with one side see through and the other reflective. The white text shines through the see through side, creating the effect of a mirror surface that has useful text such as the time or the weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our mirror currently uses the open source &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror&quot;&gt;Magic Mirror&lt;/a&gt; software. Their tag line is “The open source modular smart mirror platform” which is truly the best way to sum it up. It takes care of most of the code for us. It has many useful modules that come by default like the time and date, calendar, weather, news, and a fun little module called compliments which regularly cycles compliments. There is a very large community around the Magic Mirror software and so has an extensive &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/wiki/3rd-Party-Modules&quot;&gt;list of 3rd party modules&lt;/a&gt; that are often released as open source and so available to use. They are very easy to setup as well as remove and modify. It is as modular as they claim it to be. Modules are built in Javascript that generates HTML and CSS. If you can’t find something that lines up with what you want to do, there is plenty of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/tree/master/modules&quot;&gt;documentation available&lt;/a&gt; to help you build your own. The committee may wind up doing this as we can’t seem to find a module that easily matches the voice control we want to have for the mirror. We fully intend to release our module as open source and are currently documenting our progress. Hopefully there will be another blog post on our adventures in module making!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I happen to be very involved with the Women in Computing organization at RIT.

The white text shines through the see through side, creating the effect of a mirror surface that has useful text such as the time or the weather.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Bugfix Assignment</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/hfoss/2018/02/21/bugfix-assignment.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Bugfix Assignment" /><published>2018-02-21T00:00:02-05:00</published><updated>2018-02-21T00:00:02-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/hfoss/2018/02/21/bugfix-assignment</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/hfoss/2018/02/21/bugfix-assignment.html">&lt;p&gt;I’m currently the designer for RITLUG’s (RIT Linux User’s Group) project &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/RITlug/TigerOS&quot;&gt;TigerOS&lt;/a&gt;.

After making some adjustments to the wallpapers, the team alerted me that because the font I used for the wallpapers is not default installed on most machines so trying to open the source file for the wallpaper without the font would cause horrible things to happen.

@ctmartin did you want me to change the font? that's the only thing we're iffy about, I'm pretty sure you guys said just to export it to .jpg and 1080p
and it would be fine

Christian Martin [3:08 PM]
@gen1e the font is perfectly ok, the issues with it were to do with needing the font installed nativey in order to properly render

Regina Locicero [3:09 PM]
Then everything is resolved with that issue

Tim Zabel [3:09 PM]
@ctmartin In order to fully remove this issue, it seems we are using Roboto font. We should probably install Roboto font on the default install if it isn't already

Christian Martin [3:10 PM]
@Tjzabel21 Install not needed on TigerOS, we should just have a wiki page for the design and notate it in there

Tim Zabel [3:11 PM]
Sounds good. I'll reopen the issue, and add a note that we should have documentation that states we use the Roboto font.

Christian Martin [3:11 PM]
@Tjzabel21 make a new issue and tag it with docs
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for actually creating the documentation for the bugfix it wasn’t too difficult. The hardest part was making the export documentation. Because of how Fedora works, we have to replace some of the assets used in the system with our own logo through putting them with specific names, in specific sizes, in a specific file structure. Going back through that structure and figuring out what would need to be replaced when the logo was updated was a bit of a pain but necessary. I feel better knowing that any potential designers know what they need to do when a design is approved and it’s time to implement.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I’m currently the designer for RITLUG’s (RIT Linux User’s Group) project TigerOS.

Its about a young witch named Pepper who is not very good at witching and her adventures with her tabby cat companion Carrot. IT IS ADORABLE! Like seriously it’s so incredibly cute. It’s created by an awesome French artist named David Reevoy. Not only is he talented but he’s also super into open source. As part of this his software work flow is completely open source for Pepper &amp;amp; Carrot.  He uses Krita for his drawing, Blender for textures, and GIMP and Inkscape for other touch ups and adding text. He also creates the webcomic with a certain &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.peppercarrot.com/en/static2/philosophy&quot;&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt; in mind. He believes that all of Pepper &amp;amp; Carrot should be open source. He does this by licensing the work under Creative Commons and making the assets he used freely available. He has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/davidrevoy&quot;&gt;Patreon page&lt;/a&gt; that allows people to support him but any content that is posted on their is also posted on the public Pepper &amp;amp; Carrot website because he doesn’t want to lock anything behind a pay-wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The really cool thing was that people actually use the permissive license to remix his work. There was a very popular &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTb1_w8hvqY&quot;&gt;animation of his comic&lt;/a&gt; lead by Nikolai Mamashev and Konstantin Dmitriev. They used open source tools to animate Reevoy’s comic. They did an &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.com/article/17/6/web-comic-open-license&quot;&gt;interview with opensource.com&lt;/a&gt; if you want to learn more about their project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pepper &amp;amp; Carrot is a great example of a successful creative commons/open source artistic creation. The creator is still able to support himself while still keeping his work open source. The community also actually uses this permissive licensing to actually do some cool remixes of his work. It also shows that something of great quality can come from using FOSS software and that FOSS creative tools don’t mean a sacrifice in outputted art quality. It’s super awesome, check it out, it’s definitely worth the read.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">One of my favorite webcomics ever is Pepper &amp;amp; Carrot.

As this had been happening I was also looking at FOSS digital art and/or design programs as the industry standard Adobe products cost an arm and a leg for each program. I came across the standard FOSS tools usually mentioned such as GIMP as a Photoshop replacement and Inkscape as a Illustrator replacement but I also came across Krita, which is an open source digital painting program. From what I’ve gathered many industry standard artists use Photoshop’s brushes or other proprietary software for digital drawing. However there are many professional artists that use Krita to make stunning art pieces. In fact, a popular webcomic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.peppercarrot.com/&quot;&gt;Pepper &amp;amp; Carrot&lt;/a&gt; is created primarily using Krita by a French artist David Revoy. His comic is phenomenal and is deserving of it’s own post (which I will link to when it’s created), but here it is a good representation of the potential of what is possible with Krita.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Krita, like many drawing programs, really needs a drawing tablet. Unfortunately, these cost money. Before buying a tablet for Krita, you probably want to check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.krita.org/List_of_Tablets_Supported&quot;&gt;the list of supported tablets&lt;/a&gt;. If you already have one it’s probably supported, Krita seems to be pretty good about that. I personally have a Wacom Intuos Draw, I played with the software that came with it but I found Krita much more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Krita takes a bit of time to learn, but it’s interface is at least somewhat intuitive. The Krita community provides &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.krita.org/Main_Page&quot;&gt;a lot of documentation&lt;/a&gt; for Krita’s features and also includes a lot of tutorials. They also link to &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.krita.org/External_Training_and_Tutorials&quot;&gt;external tutorials&lt;/a&gt; and links to various resources such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.krita.org/Resources&quot;&gt;brush packs&lt;/a&gt;. Although slightly outdated now, the tutorial I used to learn the basics of Krita was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FfVnEIkA3I&amp;amp;list=PLaGRTLvEbVzybijtYZRy4EoGrx6Bq_xOG&quot;&gt;“Learn Krita with Bob Ross” series&lt;/a&gt; by the channel &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkKFLSJjYtKNdFy3P7Q-CAA&quot;&gt;Age of Asparagus&lt;/a&gt; on YouTube. It was really fun to be able to learn how to use Krita while re-creating a Bob Ross painting. As a side note if you have heard of or have seen Bob Ross in action, his entire collection of “The Joy of Painting” video series is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/BobRossInc&quot;&gt;up for free on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, watching him create a painting is like calming magic, I highly recommend giving it a watch on a boring or frustrating day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Krita offers quite a few features. It has the standard layers that most graphic programs have. Krita does come with a preset of basic brushes which can be used as a base to make your own brushes customized to your artistic needs. I find that the brush generator is very intuitive and is helpful in letting you try out the brush as you adjust it. Krita integrates well with the programmable buttons on many drawing tablets and pens. It has a quick pop-up pallet that has the brush set you are currently using. You can tag your own brushes to create your own set and be able to see them among other brushes. It’s also very easy to export and import brushes. David Reevoy has his &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Deevad/deevad-krita-brushpresets&quot;&gt;own set of brushes&lt;/a&gt; that are very popular and I find very useful. I’ve personally used Krita to help create a mottled background for wallpaper for &lt;a href=&quot;http://tigeros.ritlug.com/&quot;&gt;TigerOS&lt;/a&gt;,  a Fedora remix aimed at RIT students. I used one of Reevoy’s brushes to make it. Overall I consider a great tool that is definitely worth checking out for digital artists.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I usually don’t do art but since I’ve gone to college I’ve been embracing my creative side more.

Twine is a FOSS application that generates the code for interactive stories, much like choose your own adventure games. The first Twine was created with python and javascript which generated the html, css, and javascript that make up the game. It was based on the story engine Twee. A story engine refers to the system and format used to note how the story passages link together. Twine 2 was created with mostly javascript and using the Harlowe game engine. Twine has a friendly GUI that allows for people to easily compose a story. It also includes options to export an archive of your stories and has the option to display a proofreading copy of your story that is one html page. Although this alone is enough to make great stories, you can expand the functionality through programming. There are ways to incorporate variables inside of passages to cut down on the number of passages you need to create. You can alter the display by adding your own CSS. Also you can add your own javascript to create an inventory system, like my team did, or other possibilities. Although I appreciate Twine as a powerful tool, there are also drawbacks that come with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first issue I take is with the documentation; don’t get me wrong they have &lt;a href=&quot;http://twinery.org/wiki/&quot;&gt;an awesome wiki&lt;/a&gt; but the website is not super clear. First off the repositories the intro paragraph point to refer to the repos for Twine 1 and 2 but are unlabeled. Also the last repo they point to is not Twine itself but Harlowe, which is what Twine 2 comes with as default. Harlowe’s documentation starts with the changelog and doesn’t really accurately explain what Harlowe does in an easy to understand manner. The most prominent documentation is changelogs, which are not as useful when you don’t understand what it is in the first place. It would benefit from a more detailed intro or a link to the story format explanation on the wiki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the more picky documentation issues, my team and I found that Harlowe was not the most customizable. It was good for simple things like holding variables and such but not so flexible for adding something like an inventory system or other more complex elements. We probably would have benefited from a more customizable story format but more likely we would have needed to significantly alter Twine be able to add separate game mechanics more easily. It’s still a very powerful piece of software by maintaining all the complex branches and giving a friendly user interface, it just isn’t as customizable when it comes to changing game mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">While at WiCHacks 2018 this weekend, which entails it’s own post (coming soon), my team, the Anitfreeze Bears, used Twine to create a game.

He addresses the many issues that developers and tech support workers experience. He explains how it is necessary to include details of what exactly went wrong including error messages, what the program looks like during various stages, and the exact steps you took to get to the point of failure. He also touches on the struggles of bug reports in the FOSS world where more often than not the only form of communication is through only text. You cannot directly show the developer what went wrong, so a clearly written bug report is necessary and preferably has screen shots. He also talks about making sure the bug is reproducible as well as making sure the programmer can reproduce the bug themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found that the article was mostly aimed at users as apposed to developers. It’s more of a plea from developers to users to help us help them. The language is relatively accessible for those who have some experience with computers. That being said I still think it’s a useful reminder to developers when they are using other people’s programs. There is even a section to address this. I’ve found the article very useful as I have already sent it to some of my family members who often look to me as free tech support, in the hopes of getting clearer bug reports from them in the future. This however does bring up the point that there is no guarantee that users will actually read this even if you specifically ask them to read it before submitting a bug report. However, this doesn’t take away that this is a useful resource.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The article “How to Report Bugs Effectively” by Simon Tatham is truly a rubric on how to write a clear and detailed bug report.
